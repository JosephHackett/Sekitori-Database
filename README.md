# Sekitori-Database
A database containing professional sumo database from 1958 - Now. My goal is to update this after each basho, as well as continue to improve database design. 

## Using the database:
The SQL file contained in this repository was produced using the PostrgeSQL command `pg_dump`. You can build the database on your local machine using `psql`.
